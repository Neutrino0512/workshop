Currently, there are two ways that you can enter China without a visa:

**1. 240-Hour Visa-free Transit Policy**

The National Immigration Administration (NIA)
announced that it will fully relax and optimize the visa-free
transit policy, which is effective immediately. The stay duration
for foreign nationals eligible for visa-free transit has been
extended from the previous 72 hours and 144 hours to 240 hours
(10 days). Additionally, 21 ports of entry and exit have been
added for visa-free transit individuals, further expanding the
allowed areas for visa-free transit travelers. Individuals from 54
eligible countries, including Russia, Brazil, the United Kingdom,
the United States of America, and Canada, traveling from China
to a third country (region), can enter visa-free through any of the
60 open ports in 24 provinces, and stay within the allowed areas
for visa-free transit travelers for no more than 240 hours.

Simply speaking, for the citizens from 54 countries
mentioned in the policy, if he/she has an air ticket to a third
country/region(key point), he/she is eligible for the current
China's Visa-free Transit Policy ( up to 240 hours ). For details,
